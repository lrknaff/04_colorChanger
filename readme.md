title: Color Changer Solo
---

## Specification

You've been doing a great job over the last 3 weeks, and it's time for a solo challenge! You'll have this afternoon and evening to work on this project, and it is to be completed by start of class tomorrow morning (there will not be work time for this project tomorrow). Get as far as you can and focus on breaking the project down into small bite-sized steps, using good git workflows, and getting to working features.

The application will have the following:

- A default window background color of white
- Two buttons
  - One that sets a random background color that _cannot_ be white
  - One that resets the background color to white

### Requirements

- You are provided with comps showing colors, fonts, and layouts for desktop and for mobile, respectively. Your project should match these comps.
- The random background color cannot be white.
- The default and reset background color must be white.
- Your project must be responsive.
- Your project must be pushed to GitHub.
- Your project must be live as a [GitHub Pages project site](https://pages.github.com/).

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the layout and functional expectations.
- 3: Application meets all of the layout expectations and has one key feature fully implemented with one key feature partially implemented _OR_ meets all functional expectations and has partially implemented layout.
- 2: Application has partially implemented features and layout.
- 1: Application does not meet the requirements.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring.
- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
- 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.
- 1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution.

### Workflow

- 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
- 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
- 1: The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
- 0: The application was not checked into version control.

### HTML Style

- 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
- 2:  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.
- 1:  Developer writes code with unnecessary tags, selectors, or nesting which do not increase clarity. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application markup shows poor structure with no understanding of semantics.

### CSS Style

- 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
- 2:  Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
- 1:  Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of CSS is doing. Developer writes code with unnecessary selectors or tags which do not increase clarity.
